If you want to test the design out, use GitHub's download repo feature to download it as a zip, extract the contents of the zip into one folder, and just open up any of the .html files! Ideally, start with index.html, but all the files should have traces to every other file. 
If you use uBlockOrigin, the design will break as uBO is active on files too, so you will need to either temporarily turn it off or manually turn it off on every page. 

This project focused less on actually redesigning it and more on just learning new things in JavaScript, if you want to see what I worked on, there's two parts I'm most proud of:
- Searchbar:
  Includes history! Assuming the cookies work fine, which they probably won't, you will be able to see the last 5 searches you made.
  Pretty much a searchbar. If you want to add new entries, feel free to do so by simply modifying the array with all the searchbar entries, and everything should update automatically.
- Interactable menus:
  Popups aren't that well made yet, so don't expect much from that side of things, but almost all the initial menus can be opened up and they will also close if you click on anything but the menu.
